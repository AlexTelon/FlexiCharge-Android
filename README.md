## Project Architecture

  This branch works with Android Studio 2020.3.1, uses Android SDK 30 and supports Android 10 and above.

## The application

### Configuration Files

1. **Google Maps SDK API key**
   Enter a Google Maps SDK api-key in the file ./app/src/debug/res/values/google_maps_api.xml by replacing `PUT_API_KEY_HERE` with the actual key

2. **Klarna testing account**
   Using klarna requires Klarna Playgrond sample data. Use these personal details (You will only need to enter email and zip code once, then it will be remembered inside the app):
   **Personal Details used for Bank Transfer**

### Build Steps

1. Open project in Android Studio
2. Let gradle download all required modules
3. Compile and run application by clicking "Run"


### Using the app

1. When starting the app, grant required location permissions to continue to Home Screen.
2. In home, the user can do a multitude of things...
   * Use the map to view FlexiChargers on the **map**.![image-20211011152235679](./images/image-20211011152235679.png)
   * Tap ![image-20211011151837571](./images/image-20211011151837571.png) to "warp" to **your location**. 
   * Tap ![image-20211011151855812](./images/image-20211011151855812.png) to access FlexiCharger **QR Scanner**

1. Enter a valid ChargerID pin in the ChargingPanel, ChargerID's can be obtained by:
   * Tapping green markers on the map.
   * Scanning a QR Code present on a FlexiCharger
   * Tapping a chargepoint from the "chargepoints near me" list and selecting one available charger.

2. Tap ![image-20211011152306659](./images/image-20211011152306659.png) to make a monetary reservation for a charger. (Follow through Klarna steps, testing account described above in readme)
3. Once reservation is complete the charging process will begin automatically.
